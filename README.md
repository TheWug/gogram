# Gogram

Gogram is a library for interacting with the Telegram Bot API in Golang.

## Getting started

Follow these instructions to use `gogram` in your Golang project

### Prerequisites

You should have Golang 1.10 or newer installed. It may work with older versions, but no testing or compatibility checking has been done.

### Installing

Just import `github.com/thewug/gogram` and fetch it like any other golang library.

## Contributing

Please be a reasonable person. If you notice an actual bug, or if you want to add support for existing bot API features, you are welcome to submit a pull request. You are welcome to submit pull requests for large architectural changes as well but do so at your own peril, I may decide not to use them.
